The following information depicts where i got my "special effects" and a short hand discription of how i manipulated them for my game.
i give full credit to the following sources as well as the two books i used

1:Introduction to programmin in java (prescribed)
2:java in easy steps by Mike McGrath (ISBN: 1-84078-259-5)

1) The initial start screen was manipulated using a " keep calm" app downloaded from the appstore,
this was used to add the test and the image at the beginning of the text. Although the backgroungd image 
was downloaded from google image search but the url given from there is: "https://www.google.co.za/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&docid=ld0McybUtcoLsM&tbnid=3Eym6tGPbOLGyM:&ved=0CAUQjRw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.seriouscorp.clumsybird&ei=msRBU-H1AsGz0QWIzoCwCQ&bvm=bv.64125504,d.bGQ&psig=AFQjCNHK3xzyK1hytmGJYKKoFyhmPm7_zw&ust=1396905490576747"
or simply searching flappy bird 
this was manly manipulated by cropping and stretching in MS Paint.

2)When the game starts, there are pipes, an image of a bird, which changes as the velocity changes and 
ground and a background.
Concerning these images:
I took the images and cropped them. after this i had two box images, i used photoshop and removed the extra layer around the birds.
I then had two birds with transparencies around them. i started filling out the colour and made distinctions between the wings of the birds.After doing this i took the one
image if the bird which had the modified upward wing and tilted it at an angle as if it was looking up.
for the gorund and background i just resized them and filled colours.
the pipes had to be cut out using photoshop and stretched etc.
these were all found via google image search and the image url is, "http://www.google.co.za/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&docid=4OzKLfs6VD6ExM&tbnid=U4uyCOZvxLDCXM:&ved=0CAgQjRw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spriters-resource.com%2Fmobile_phone%2Fflappybird%2Fsheet%2F59537%2F&ei=cMVBU-HgJqqBywOwyYKoAw&psig=AFQjCNEVGwmaCk0HBYXMvwX1ka78-Qu32g&ust=1396905712761200"
or searching flappy bird sheet

3) The end game image was when flappy dies etc. was downloaded from, "https://www.teepublic.com/show/14629-r.i.p.-flappy-bird" or searching flappy bird dead,
this image was cropped and stretched using MS paint and Photoshop CS6 was used to fill remaining white "areas".
